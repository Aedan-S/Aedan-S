# 🏄‍♂️ Hey! I’m Aedan 
I'm an Australian programmer and technical designer based in Norway. I'm proficient in Unity (C#), web dev (js) and Unreal (blueprints) with a bachelor's in generalist game development, and postgrad degree in AR & VR app development.
- 🐣 I've been creating games since 11 years old. I started out on MIT's visual scripting platform Scratch [(Where one of my projects got featured on the front page)](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11436928/).
- 💻📲 Platforms I've developed games for include **PC**, **WebGL**, **Mobile** and **Meta Quest 2/3**
- 🛶 I'm also into graphic design, hiking, kayaking, game jams, board games, word games, concerts and dabbling in electronic music production. I'm also good at mario kart.
