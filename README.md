My journey  of programming and designing games started when I was 13 years old making games on MIT's Scratch [(Where one of my projects got featured on the front page)](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11436928/) and now I develop in **Unity** full time for the past 3 years. I also have 6 months experience in **Unreal Engine**.

- 💻📲 The platforms I've developed games for include PC, Android and WebGL.
- 👨‍💻 My IDE of choice is **Rider**.
- 🛶 My hobbies include going to game jams, hiking, kayaking, concerts, board games, word games, watching Formula 1, travelling, making graphic designs and dabbling in electronic music production.
