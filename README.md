# 🦘 Hey there! I’m Aedan - an aussie game designer based in Norway
- 🎓 I just completed my bachelor's in game development! 🎮 I’m passionate in many aspects of game development, mainly **gameplay programming** and core **game design**, but I also enjoy design auxillary UX stuff
- 🐣 I absolutely adore games, I've been playing them since a child and now love creating them. My journey  of programming and designing games started when I was 13 years old making games on MIT's visual scripting platform Scratch [(Where one of my projects got featured on the front page)](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11436928/) and now I develop in **Unity** full time for the past 3 years. I also have 6 months experience in **Unreal Engine**
- 🔧 I’m experienced in **C#, Unity, Unreal blueprints, game design, graphic design and web design**
- 💻📲 The platforms I've developed games for include **PC**, **Android** and **WebGL**
- 👨‍💻 My IDE of choice is **Rider**
- 🛶 I'm into game jams, hiking, kayaking, concerts, board games, word games, Formula 1, travelling, graphic design and dabbling in electronic music production.
