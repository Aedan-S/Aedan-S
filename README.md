- 👋 G'day! I’m Aedan - a 22y/o Australian game dev student currently studying in Norway. 🇦🇺 ✈ 🇳🇴
- 👀 I’m passionate in many aspects of game development, mainly **gameplay programming** in **C#**, game design, UX design, as well as desigining and implementing UI.  I absolutely love games, I've been playing them since a child and now love creating them. My love for programming and designing games started when I was 13 years old making games on MIT's Scratch [(Link to my project that got featured on the front page)](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11436928/)  and now I develop in **Unity** full time for the past 3 years. I also have 6 months experience in **Unreal Engine**.
- 🌱 I’m experienced in **C#, Unity, Unreal blueprints, game design, graphic design and web design.**
- 💻 The platforms I've developed games for include PC, Android and WebGL.
- 👨‍💻 My IDE of choice is **Rider**.
- 🛶 My hobbies include going to game jams, hiking, kayaking, board games, watching Formula 1, travelling, making graphic designs and dabbling in electronic music production.
